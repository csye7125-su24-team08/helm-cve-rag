# CVE-RAG-Stack Helm Chart

## Overview

The **CVE-RAG-Stack Helm Chart** is a powerful tool designed to deploy a fully functional API and user interface (UI) for interacting with the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. This chart enables seamless communication with the **Ollama** model deployed within your Kubernetes (K8s) cluster, allowing users to leverage advanced AI capabilities effortlessly.

## Features

- **Prebuilt API and UI**: The Helm chart comes with a ready-to-use API and UI, enabling users to interact with the RAG framework without extensive setup.
  
- **Ollama Integration**: Directly communicates with the Ollama model deployed in your Kubernetes environment, ensuring efficient data processing and retrieval.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The UI is designed for ease of use, allowing users to easily input queries and visualize responses from the RAG framework.

- **Scalability**: Built on Kubernetes, the stack can easily scale to accommodate increased load and user demand.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- A running Kubernetes cluster
- Helm 3.x installed
- Access to a container registry (if using custom images)

### Steps to Deploy

1. **Add the Helm Repository**:
   ```bash
   helm repo add cve-rag-stack https://github.com:csye7125-su24-team08/helm-cve-rag.git
   helm repo update
   ```

2. **Install the Chart**:
   ```bash
   helm install cve-rag-stack cve-rag-stack/helm-cve-rag -n chatbot-ns
   ```

3. **Configure the Environment**:
   - Create a configuration file to set environment variables for the API and UI:
     ```bash
     cp values.yaml.example values.yaml
     ```
   - Edit `values.yaml` to configure the Ollama model endpoint and other necessary parameters.

4. **Access the Application**:
   - After deployment, you can access the UI via the service URL. Use the following command to get the service details:
     ```bash
     kubectl get svc -n chatbot-ns
     ```

## Usage

Once deployed, you can interact with the RAG stack through the UI. The API endpoints are also available for programmatic access, allowing developers to integrate the functionality into their applications.

### Example API Calls

- **Send a Query**:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://<api-url>/query -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"input": "Your query here"}'
  ```

- **Get Responses**:
  Responses will be returned in JSON format, providing structured data for easy consumption.

## Security Considerations

- Regularly update the Helm chart and monitor for vulnerabilities in the Ollama model and other dependencies.
- Implement network policies to restrict access to the API and UI as needed.
- Use Kubernetes secrets to manage sensitive information such as API keys.

## Conclusion

The **CVE-RAG-Stack Helm Chart** simplifies the deployment of a robust API and UI for interacting with the RAG framework and the Ollama model. With its user-friendly design and seamless integration, developers can focus on building innovative AI applications without the overhead of complex configurations. Enjoy harnessing the power of AI with ease!
