# Helm CVE RAG

This project utilizes Helm charts to create two deployments, one to host the API for Cloud Infrastructure Vulnerability Recommendation system, and another to host the UI. It also creates other resources relevant to the deployments.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Helm
- Kubernetes cluster
- PostgreSQL with pgvector
- OpenAI account

## Installation

To deploy the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git
  ```

2. Change into the project directory:

  ```shell
  cd helm-cve-rag
  ```

3. Install the Helm chart:

  ```shell
  helm install my-release ./helm-chart -n my-namespace
  ```

4. Wait for the deployment to complete:

  ```shell
  kubectl get pods
  ```

## Configuration

The Helm chart can be customized by modifying the values in the `values.yaml` file. Update the necessary configurations such as Kafka and PostgreSQL connection details according to your environment. You will need to update the OpenAI API key field.

## Usage

Once the deployments are successful, the UI will be accessible through chatbot-ui-service. You can monitor the logs of the application to ensure everything is running smoothly.
